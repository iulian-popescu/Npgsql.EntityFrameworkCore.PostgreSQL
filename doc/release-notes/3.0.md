## Breaking changes

> [!CAUTION]
> The default value generation strategy has changed from the older SERIAL columns to the newer IDENTITY columns.
>
> When producing a migration with 3.0, the Npgsql provider will attempt to automatically generate SQL to alter your tables and convert serial columns
> to identity ones. This is a sensitive, one-time migration operation that should be done with care, and carefully tested before deployment to production.
>
> You can instruct the provider to continue using serial columns by calling `modelBuilder.UseSerialColumns()` in your models' `OnModelCreating`.
> If you are using PostgreSQL 9.6 or earlier, it is recommended to call `SetPostgresVersion(9, 6)` in your model's `OnConfiguring` for general 9.6 compatibility,
> which will include serial column. 
>
> More information is available in [the doc page about generated properties](../modeling/value-generation.md).
