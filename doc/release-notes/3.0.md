## Breaking changes

> [!CAUTION]
> The default value generation strategy has changed from the older SERIAL columns to the newer IDENTITY columns.
>
> When producing a migration with 3.0, the Npgsql provider will attempt to automatically generate SQL to alter your tables and convert serial columns
> to identity ones. This is a sensitive, one-time migration operation that should be done with care, and carefully tested before deployment to production.
> You may also explicitly opt out of this change, more information is available in [the doc page about generated properties](../modeling/value-generation.md).
